  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a Cloud Engineer with experience in GCP, Terraform, and Python. My work focuses on designing and maintaining cloud infrastructure, developing automated data pipelines, and supporting internal analytics teams.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have led projects involving ETL pipelines, automated testing, and Salesforce app development. Before my current role, I earned a B.S. in Software Engineering from Arizona State University and worked on software engineering projects in both banking and technology domains.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am excited about deepening my understanding of <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>, 
    <strong>cloud engineering</strong>, and <strong>data systems</strong>. In the future, 
    I plan to pursue a <strong>Master's degree in Computer Science</strong> to build 
    stronger foundations in machine learning, distributed systems, and large-scale 
    analytics. My goal is to bridge <strong>research and real-world applications</strong>, 
    creating intelligent and reliable systems that can make a meaningful impact.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new technologies, planning infrastructure architectures, and occasionally experimenting with cooking and photography.
